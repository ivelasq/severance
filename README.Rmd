# severance <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="300" />

The severance package contains color palettes for R inspired by the show [Severance](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/severance/umc.cmc.1srk2goyh2q2zdxcx605w8vtx).

Images were sourced from the [Apple TV+ Press website](https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/severance/episodes-images/). The structure of the package was based on the [MetBrewer package](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer) by Blake R. Mills and the [wesanderson package](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) by Karthik Ram.

## Installation

You can install the development version of severance from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ivelasq/severance")
```

## Examples

Here are examples of the severange package using [TidyTuesday data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-02-23/readme.md) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The plot is based on one created by Amanda Luby from the [Swarthmore College Data Visualization Group](https://aluby.domains.swarthmore.edu/sdv/posts/2021-03-05-bls-earnings-data/).

```{r plot-ref}
#| ref.label = "plot",
#| echo = FALSE,
#| message = FALSE,
#| dpi = 300,
#| fig.alt = "Three steamplots showing the gender disparity between races displayed in three different palettes from the severance package"
```

The code to reproduce the plot is below:

```{r}
#| label = "plot",
#| eval = FALSE
library(severance)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

  hjust = 0,
  nrow = 1
)

caption <- ggdraw() +
  draw_label("Source: BLS Earnings Data",
             hjust = -0.3,
             vjust = -0.5)

plot_grid(title,
          prow,
          caption,
          ncol = 1,
